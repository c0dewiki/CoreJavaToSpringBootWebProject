## Spring Annotations

### `@Configuration`
- **Purpose:**
  - Indicates that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans.
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to classes that define Spring configuration.
### `@ComponentScan`
- **Purpose:**
  - Configures the scanning of the specified package for Spring components (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`).
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to configuration classes to specify the base packages to scan for components.
### `@Component`
- **Purpose:**
  - Indicates that a class is a Spring component, and the Spring container should manage it as a bean.
  ### `@RestController`
- **Purpose:**
  - Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
  - Used for creating RESTful web services.
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to classes to indicate that all methods return data suitable for RESTful services.
### `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`
- **Purpose:**
  - `@Controller`: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.
  - `@ResponseBody`: Indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body.
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to classes for handling HTTP requests and returning data.
### `@Service`
- **Purpose:**
  - Marks a class as a service class in the business layer.
  - Typically used to hold business logic.
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to service classes.
### `@Repository`
- **Purpose:**
  - Indicates that a class is a Data Access Object (DAO).
  - Converts checked exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException.
- **Usage:**
  - Applied to classes at the persistence layer.
These annotations are part of the Spring framework and are used to configure and manage various components within a Spring-based application. Depending on the type of class and its role in the application, you would apply the relevant annotation(s) to enable Spring to handle it appropriately.
